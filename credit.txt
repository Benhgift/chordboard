"""test.py - integrating xinput.XInputJoystick with pygame for Windows + Xbox 360 controller

Windows Xbox 360 cannot use pygame events for the left and right trigger. The axis doesn't come through distinctly.
This alternative corrects that issue, and adds functions unique to the Xbox controller.

General approach:

1. Detect joysticks.
2. Detect Windows.
3. Detect Xbox 360 controller.
4. Set up the joystick device platform+controller option.

For non-Windows controllers use pygame's joystick.Joystick as usual.

For Xbox 360 controller on Windows use xinput.XInputJoystick:

1. Do "joystick = xinput.XInputJoystick()".
2. Do "if WINDOWS_XBOX_360: joystick.dispatch_events()" each game tick to poll the device.
3. Handle pygame events as usual.
